# Personal Information Code
This Python program defines a dictionary containing personal information and prints it.

## Code Explanation
The code creates a dictionary named
"my_info" with the following keys:
"name': chiomaanii
"discipline": "cell biology and genetics"
"hobby": gazing at...
"slack username"
"email",
"country",
"preferred programming language".

The program then prints the information stored in the dictionary.

## Code Example:
'Python'
my_info = {
"name": "chiomanii", 
"slack username": "oma",
"email": "chiomam260@gmail.com", 
"hobby":"gazing at the beauty of nature in its diversity",
"country": "Nigeria",
"discipline": "cell biology and genetics",
"preferred programming language": "python"
}
print(my_info)
this code outputs the dictionary with all the details about the user, like this
"chiomaanii", "oma", "chiomam260@gmail.com", "gazing at the beauty of nature in its diversity", 'Nigeria", "cell biology and genetics", "python".

yeah, that's it. Hope you get it!
